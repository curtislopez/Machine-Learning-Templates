*** STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS ***

These are the following templates that have really been adjusted by me for a more realistic application:
-Linear Regression (lol)

That's it for now haha.  

Next templates on the docket will be logistic regression, SVM, and lightGBM. 
I don't think the SVM template accounts for different kernels, and lightGBM's template just needs a lot more tuning...for the tuning section.  

Glancining over the other sections, KNN looks relatively alright but I mean there's not much else to tune so sure. 

*** HOPING THIS WILL BECOME MORE HELPFUL BY 8/30! ***
